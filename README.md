<h1>Azure Basics: VMs, NSG and Network Protocols</h1>
In this project I'll show how the basics of Microsoft Azure work and can be utilized by analyzing common Internet Protocols such as ICMP, SSH, DHCP, etc.<br />

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Wireshark

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10</b> (21H2)
- Linux (Ubuntu)</br>

<h2>Setting up inside Azure</h2>
<p>
  First thing we need to do is create a <b>Resource Group</b>, these are storage inside our Azure subscription that can be used to store any service we may need, like a <b>Virtual Machine</b> or a <b>Network Security Group</b>.<br>
  We can easily create one by going into the <b>Resource Group</b> tab and clicking on <b>Create Resource Group</b>.

  Choose a Subscription and a Name, then create, and you should have your group ready to use.

</p>
<p>
  Now that the group is created, we can begin to put it into use. In this case, We'll create a Virtual Machine (VM) and a Network Security Group (NSG).<br>
  To create a VM, just type Virtual Machine in the search bar and create.
